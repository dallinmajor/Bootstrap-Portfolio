                    Hi, and welcome to the cool web page I build with my own two digital hands.
                    Feel free to browse around. As you can see you can contact me from this website via the Contact
                    tab located in the upper right hand corner. If you'd like to check out my sweet projects click on my Portfolio tab.
                    If you like to learn more about me, you've come to the right spot. I'm sure you have noticed by now the picture of my beautiful family.
                    I mean, common on, I have a beautiful wife and the most adorable daughter. If that photo didn't catch your eye then you have problems.
                    They are my love and my life. I got into coding because of them. Well, partly. The other reason is that I hope to use technology to solve a problem created by technology;
                    a problem that I refer to as the "Social Media Crisis". A little dramatic, I know, but I think you understand right away.
                    I mean, how could you not, It effects most everyone with internet access and a mobile device. There has been loads of scientific research that has been done on the subject
                    ever since people started noticing that it has a powerful pull on their life. I don't even feel like I need to say it but I will.
                    Social Media has negative effects on society! There I said it. It does, or at least it does in the way that we Americans use it.
                    But there is hope. I am devoted to helping fix this problem. I want to help people connect face to face
                    in a fun interactive way. I wish to make it easier for you and people you don't know but who share similar interests to meet face to face.
                    Remember Pokemon Go. Think what you will about it, It changed things. If you don't believe me go look at old news stories or blogs.
                    The stories are there. In short kids who never made it out of the house came out of the house. Groups of strangers meet, friendships were made,
                    a true and genuine sense of belonging grew out of it. I think you get where I am going with this. I want to do THAT! or something like that. I want
                    to make stuff that creates those kind of interactions and experiences. I think it will be done. And I am going to do it using my skills in coding
                    combined with my passion for tabletop board games. Yaaahooooo! (not to be confused with yahoo)
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            I hope that helped shed some light on who I am. I may not have been autobiographical but I feel like it shows a truer me.
            These are the things that I care about: My Family and the Human Race. This is a way I feel I can contribute.
            So..... yeah. Don't much know what else to tell ya. :)   Thanks for chekcing out my page and I hope you enjoy some of the projects I've been working on.
